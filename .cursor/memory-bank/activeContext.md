# Active Context: ClipForge

## Current Status: PR 3 Complete - Testing Phase

**Development Phase:** PR 2 (Drag-and-Drop & File Handling)  
**Current Focus:** Implementing drag-and-drop import functionality  
**Last Updated:** After PR 1 completion

## Current Work Focus

### Completed (PR 1)
1. ✅ Electron project structure initialized
2. ✅ Package.json configured with TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS
3. ✅ Electron main process (main.js) created
4. ✅ IPC handler structure setup
5. ✅ Basic three-panel UI layout (Import, Preview, Timeline)

### Current Phase
**PR 2: Drag-and-Drop & File Handling** - Currently implementing:
- D&D event listeners in ImportArea component
- File path validation and IPC transfer
- File extension validation (.mp4/.mov only)

## Recent Changes

- **README.md Updated** - Comprehensive project documentation added based on PRD
- **Memory Bank Updated** - Documentation reflects current project status (PR 1 complete, PR 2 in progress)
- **PR 1 Complete** - Application now launches successfully with visual layout
- **Technology Stack Selected** - React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **IPC infrastructure** - Basic handlers setup with context bridge
- **Memory bank initialized** - Documentation structure created
- **PRD reviewed** - Project requirements understood
- **Task list reviewed** - 6 sequential PRs planned

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technology Choices (Binding Decisions)
- **Electron** - Desktop framework with Node.js for file/process management
- **React + TypeScript** - UI framework selected for type safety and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **fluent-ffmpeg** - Media processing via FFmpeg wrapper (installed, not yet implemented)
- **HTML5 `<video>`** - Preview playback in renderer process

### Implementation Strategy
- Use built-in Electron dialog module for file operations
- Use HTML5 video element for preview
- Use fluent-ffmpeg/ffprobe for metadata extraction
- Keep UI framework choice flexible for fastest implementation

### Critical Path to Success
The project follows a sequential PR approach:
1. Foundation (current phase)
2. Drag-and-drop implementation
3. Media preview and metadata
4. Timeline and trimming UI
5. FFmpeg export logic
6. Polish and final build

## Open Questions

1. **Build Tool:** electron-builder is installed but not yet configured. Will need configuration for final packaging.
2. **Testing Strategy:** Manual testing at each PR checkpoint is planned. No automated tests yet.

## Blockers

None currently - PR 1 acceptance criteria met, proceeding with PR 2.

## Next Milestone

Complete **PR 2: Drag-and-Drop & File Handling** with all acceptance criteria met:
- Valid files accepted (.mp4/.mov)
- Invalid files rejected gracefully
- File path successfully transferred via IPC
- State storage for valid files working
