# Progress: ClipForge

## Current Status

**Project Phase:** PR 2 In Progress (Drag-and-Drop Implementation)  
**Development Status:** PR 1 Complete, Core Foundation Built  
**Last Updated:** After PR 1 completion

## What Works

âœ… **PR 1: Foundation & Project Scaffolding - COMPLETE**
- Application launches successfully with Electron
- Three-panel layout (Import, Preview, Timeline) is visible
- No console errors during launch
- IPC infrastructure setup with context bridge
- React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS configured
- Main process and renderer process properly separated
- Build pipeline working (TypeScript â†’ Webpack â†’ Electron)

## What's Left to Build

### PR 1: Foundation & Project Scaffolding âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Electron main.js setup
- [x] Package.json with dependencies
- [x] IPC channel definitions (infrastructure ready)
- [x] Basic three-panel layout (Import, Preview, Timeline)
- [x] Application launch testing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Application launches successfully
- [x] No console errors/warnings
- [x] Layout panels are visually distinct

### PR 2: Drag-and-Drop & File Handling ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] D&D event listeners in Import Area
- [ ] File path IPC transfer
- [ ] File validation (.mp4/.mov only)
- [ ] State storage for valid files

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Valid files accepted
- [ ] Invalid files rejected gracefully

### PR 3: Media Preview & Metadata Extraction (Not Started)
- [ ] FFprobe integration
- [ ] Duration and resolution extraction
- [ ] Metadata IPC response
- [ ] HTML5 video element setup

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Video loads and plays
- [ ] State reflects accurate metadata

### PR 4: Timeline & Trimming UI/Logic (Not Started)
- [ ] Visual clip bar rendering
- [ ] Drag handles implementation
- [ ] Time conversion logic
- [ ] Player sync (scrub functionality)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Trimming handles function correctly
- [ ] Player sync works

### PR 5: FFmpeg Export Logic (Not Started)
- [ ] Export button implementation
- [ ] Save dialog integration
- [ ] FFmpeg command construction
- [ ] Command execution and completion

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Export dialogue appears
- [ ] Trimmed export is correct
- [ ] Untrimmed export is correct

### PR 6: Polish, Progress & Final Build (Not Started)
- [ ] Progress indicator UI
- [ ] Progress reporting via IPC
- [ ] UI polish and refinement
- [ ] Build configuration
- [ ] Final packaged executable

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Progress is displayed
- [ ] Responsiveness is maintained
- [ ] Final product is runnable

## Timeline

- **Start Date:** Project initialization
- **Target Deadline:** Tuesday, October 28th, 10:59 PM CT
- **Current Phase:** PR 2 - Drag-and-Drop Implementation
- **Days Remaining:** Dependent on start date
- **Progress:** 1 of 6 PRs complete (17% of structured milestones)

## Known Issues

None currently - PR 1 completed successfully without issues.

## Technical Debt

None yet - clean slate project.

## Testing Status

- Manual testing planned for each PR
- Acceptance criteria defined for each PR
- No automated tests planned for MVP
- Final executable testing before deadline

## Blockers

None currently.

## Next Immediate Steps

1. âœ… Create package.json with Electron and dependencies
2. âœ… Set up main.js with basic window creation
3. âœ… Set up index.html with three-panel layout
4. âœ… Define IPC channels in both processes
5. âœ… Test application launch
6. ðŸš§ Implement drag-and-drop in ImportArea component
7. Add file validation logic to main process
8. Test with valid and invalid file types

## Success Metrics

The project will be considered successful when:
1. All 6 PRs are complete
2. All acceptance criteria met
3. Application runs as native executable
4. Core workflow (import â†’ trim â†’ export) works end-to-end
5. Final build is packaged and distributable

## Risk Areas

1. **FFmpeg Integration** - Must ensure FFmpeg is properly installed and accessible
2. **IPC Communication** - Complex async flow between Main and Renderer
3. **Timeline Synchronization** - Ensuring video preview syncs with playhead
4. **Export Quality** - FFmpeg command construction for correct trimming
5. **Build Process** - Creating working executable for both platforms
6. **Time Constraints** - 24-hour deadline requires efficient execution
